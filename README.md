# Flamerino

Flamerino is a Discord bot. This bot was made to help organize a brazilian community in Discord, named Nocturnal Flame, that was created inside the game Final Fantasy XIV.
Flamerino has some features that helps the community leaders to control some aspects about the game, like "Buff reminders" and also disseminate information to the members. All the features will be listed below.

This bot still can't be invited to others Discord servers besides the Nocturnal Flame server, but I intend to change that in the future. In any case, as Flamerino is an open-source software, feel free to copy, modify and deploy it on your server.
I tried to make the bot's structure as clear as possible so that it wouldn't be difficult to modify, however, if you have any questions, I'm available to help. Step-by-step instructions on how to implement the bot can be seen in the end.

# ðŸ”¥ Features

In this section will be listed all the Flamerino features.

## ðŸ”¥ Reminders

Flamerino can set a reminder to be played every day at a certain time. You can see the example bellow, that is used to remind the community leaders to activate the "buff" to the players every single day.
First, the bot sends a message and a button, then when the person or group that must be remembered clicks the button, the text changes and the button change color.

# ðŸ”¥ How can I copy and config this bot in my discord server?

Like I said in the beginning, this bot cannot be invited to other servers yet. I still haven't had time to set this up and release it for public use. This is a plan. I apologize for that.
Anyway, if you still really want to use this bot, I'll go through a step-by-step guide below to help you with the process.

If you are familiar with programming and/or javascript, it will be very easy to set up this bot. If you don't have one, look for a friend who has a little basic programming knowledge to help you.

First of all, this bot uses mongoDB to store data. So, in order to use it, you have to create a [mongoDB](mongodb.com) account and set a cluster. You can get a shared cluster for free.

You must create a bot in Discord in the [Development Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Then you must install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

After that, you can start setting the files. So, you must save a copy in your computer, open a command prompt (cmd), enter in the folder that you saved and run the command above:

```
npm install
```

Then, you have to create a file named ".env". Inside this file you have to copy the data above:

```
TOKEN = YOURDISCORDTOKEN
MONGODB="THEMONGODBADRESS"
```

Please change the information that comes after "=".

In this files above you must change the variable "cargoAdm" for the id of the discord role the has power of administrator.

```
scr\commands\misc\ajuda.js
scr\commands\misc\comandos.js
```

In this files above you must change the variable "guildMensagem" for you server (guild) id and "chanelMensagem" for the channel id that you want that bot sends the alerts (reminders and birthday).

```
scr\events\ready\02reminderCreator.js
scr\utils\birthdayReminder.js
```

Finally, you can enter in the folder "scr" in the command prompt (cmd) and run the command to run the server:

```
node index.js
```

Now, the bot should be working. It'll be running in your computer. If you want to the bot runs 24/7 you must find a hosting website like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
